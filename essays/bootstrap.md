I have always wanted to learn more about web development. Web development has such a far reach on our society today, and will continue its hold untill the end of time. Web Development can be so complex and also ever so simple and elegant. The pictures above is from a practice WOD I accomplished and well above the time frame. This one was special to me because it was a place that me and my wife used to spend time while we were dating. I feel I did a good job with this one, and am eager to learn more about web development.

BootStrap-5 is a framework for web designers to make their lives easier. In one of the WODS, we did the same design with and without bootstrap 5. The time of completion significantly decreased as well as lines of code. Bootstrap 5 has a wide variety of functions in their library. My favorite function is the ease of use to create navagation bars. Using the navbar functionality along with built in buttons, dropdown menus and much more really make it easy to create a nice looking web page. 

I am excited to continue my learning of Bootstrap 5 and more frameworks to make much more up to date web pages. I could see myself doing a Web developing job again because the possibilities are endless with it. Thank you for your time reading my article!
